Configure the &ldquo;Unconstrained Kerberos Delegation&rdquo; on the &ldquo;Front-End&rdquo; AP.</strong></p><p><span id=1><img src=/demystify_kerberos_delegation/3.png class=center style=border-radius:8px></p><p>The &ldquo;Unconstrained Kerberos Delegation&rdquo; is configured via <a href=https://serveracademy.com/blog/active-directory-users-and-computers-aduc-installation-and-tutorial/>ADUC</a> by enabling the property &ldquo;Trust this computer for delegation to any service (Kerberos only)&rdquo; on the &ldquo;Computer&rdquo; object that acts as the &ldquo;Front-End&rdquo; AP; since this configuration is potentially dangerous, such action can only be performed by a Domain Admin account or an account with the &ldquo;<a href=https://harmj4.rssing.com/chan-30881824/article60.html>SeEnableDelegationPrivilege</a>&rdquo; permission.</p><span id=244><blockquote><p>In reality, even an object of type &ldquo;user&rdquo; (domain account) can be configured with the Kerberos Unconstrained Delegation, in this way such domain account will be able to impersonate another domain account to authenticate against target APs (services), however, to do this it is necessary that such account has at least 1 SPN configured, in fact only in this specific case the &ldquo;Delegation&rdquo; tab will appear inside the property of the user object.
<span id=301><span id=25>This configuration sets in the &ldquo;UserAccountControl&rdquo; property of the object in question the flag &ldquo;TRUSTED_FOR_DELEGATION&rdquo; to &ldquo;TRUE&rdquo; / &ldquo;1&rdquo;.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span id=11>Every object of type &ldquo;User&rdquo; and type &ldquo;Computer&rdquo; has an attribute called &ldquo;<a href=https://activedirectorypro.com/useraccountcontrol-check-and-manage-attribute-value/>UserAccountControl</a>&rdquo;, this attribute is a value that represents the set of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-useraccountcontrol?redirectedfrom=MSDN">flags</a> (configurations) set on the object (the most common are DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH, NOT_DELEGATE, etc.), for example 514 indicates that the domain user is disabled.</p></blockquote><p>In our <a href=/posts/demystify_kerberos_delegation/#1>example</a> the Kerberos Delegation is configured on the Computer &ldquo;THEPUNISHER&rdquo; which will act as the &ldquo;Front-End&rdquo; AP, this modification is actually reflected on the related Computer Account since it is contained in the &ldquo;Computer&rdquo; object (therefore the Computer Account THEPUNISHER$ will have the flag &ldquo;TRUSTED_FOR_DELEGATION&rdquo; set to &ldquo;TRUE&rdquo; / &ldquo;1&rdquo;), this means that any service started by this computer with the Service Account THEPUNISHER$ (Computer Account) will have the Kerberos Unconstrained Delegation enabled (<a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#17>so, all services started with the Local Service account such as by default the CIFS service</a>).</p><p><span id=4><img src=/demystify_kerberos_delegation/4.png class=center style=border-radius:8px></p><blockquote><p>By default ALL Domain Controllers have the Kerberos Unconstrained Delegation enabled.</p></blockquote><p><strong>2. Configure the domain user that performs Kerberos authentication to the &ldquo;Front-End&rdquo; AP as &ldquo;relayable&rdquo;.</strong></p><p>It is necessary that the domain user that performs Kerberos authentication to the &ldquo;Front-End&rdquo; AP does NOT have the &ldquo;NOT_DELEGATED&rdquo; flag set to &ldquo;TRUE&rdquo; / &ldquo;1&rdquo; in the &ldquo;UserAccountControl&rdquo; property; if it is, then that user is NOT delegable, by default ALL domain users do NOT have this flag enabled and are therefore relayable.</p><img src=/demystify_kerberos_delegation/5.png class=center style=border-radius:8px><br><hr><br><p><strong>Below we see the flow of a Kerberos authentication with &ldquo;Unconstrained Delegation&rdquo; enabled:</strong></p><blockquote><p>To simplify the creation of the lab, even though this would hardly happen in reality, in the following screenshots the Front-End AP will be the CIFS service hosted on the THEPUNISHER computer (this service, having &ldquo;Local System&rdquo; as Service Account, <a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#17>in a Kerberos context the Service Account will be the Computer Account THEPUNISHER$</a>), in reality, usually, a Front-End AP could be a Web Application.</p></blockquote><img src=/demystify_kerberos_delegation/6.png class=center style=border-radius:8px><blockquote><p>The &ldquo;KRB_AP_REP&rdquo; packet (<a href=/posts/demystify_kerberos_delegation/#9>&ldquo;AP Front-End&rdquo; -> &ldquo;Client&rdquo;</a> & &ldquo;<a href=/posts/demystify_kerberos_delegation/#10>AP Back-End&rdquo; -> &ldquo;AP Front End</a>&rdquo;) required by the Mutual Authentication could be sent in different times based on the Windows machine version used inside the infrastructure, this is the reason why i have not putted them on the image.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span id=2>Integrity and authenticity verification operations that occur within traditional Kerberos authentication (sending & analyzing the &ldquo;Authenticator&rdquo; along with the related &ldquo;Session Key&rdquo; used to encrypt & decrypt parts of the packet) are also present with Unconstrained Delegation enabled, but in this case they will NOT be mentioned, because they have already been generally described <a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/>previously</a> (for a complete analysis in the context of Unconstrained Delegation see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDFRUYv1-eU&amp;t=326s">this guide</a>) and because it was preferred to instead emphasize the unique characteristics of Kerberos Unconstrained Delegation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#40>As already mentioned previously</a>, below we will describe the traditional process where Kerberos with Unconstrained Delegation enabled is used, that is, from an Interactive Logon where a user enters their credentials within a WinLOGON GUI, and then subsequently uses Kerberos again in a Network Logon (roughly using cached credentials) to authenticate to a target service with Kerberos Unconstrained Delegation enabled; that said, in reality, the authentication process can also start in other types of authentications besides the traditional WinLOGON GUI (Interactive Logon).</p></blockquote><hr><br><p><strong>Introduction: Initially, the Client (after the domain user has entered their credentials for an Interactive Logon) makes a request for a TGT Ticket & TGS Session Key (KRB_AS_REQ) to the KDC and it responds (KRB_AS_REP) providing the requested data (if positive, in summary, the Client grants access to the domain user).</strong></p><h3 id=1-krb_tgs_req-the-client-provides-its-own-tgt-ticket-to-the-kdc-to-request-the-tgs-ticket><strong>1.
