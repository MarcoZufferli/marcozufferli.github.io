it replaces the NTLM protocol (specifically, <a href=https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTLM#NTLMv2>NTLMv2</a>) but it should be noted that it can only operate in Active Directory contexts and NOT in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workgroup_%28computer_networking%29>Workgroup</a>.</p><p>In a traditional Active Directory authentication scenario, when a user performs a domain authentication on a WorkStation / Server (Interactive Logon) the Client uses the Kerberos protocol for authentication and if, subsequently, the domain user already logged into the Client needs to authenticate with their domain credentials towards a target network service such as SMB (Network Logon), the Kerberos protocol, having SSO capabilities, is used again by the Client.</p><p>In a Microsoft Active Directory domain, Kerberos is the primary authentication mechanism, for both Interactive Logon and Network Logon (actually also for other LogonTypes), that said, if for any reason the Kerberos protocol CANNOT operate (as when performing a network authentication specifying an IP as the <a href=https://zer1t0.gitlab.io/posts/attacking_ad/#ntlm-in-active-directory>target and not a hostname in Windows utilities</a>, and in fact this is a method to force NTLMv2 authentication over Kerberos) Windows will use the previously available network authentication protocol, that is (usually) NTLMv2; that said, in this section we will detail the Kerberos protocol in all its phases, starting from a scenario that unfolds with an Interactive Logon up to a possible Network Logon.</p><p>Kerberos works over the TCP and UDP protocol in clear-text, in fact there is no possibility to implement encryption of the entire communication channel using OpenSSL, this is because it is the Kerberos protocol itself that is responsible for encryption, consequently the encryption mechanism of the Kerberos protocol consists of sending a series of partially already encrypted packets within an unencrypted connection (communication channel).</p><p>Kerberos is an authentication protocol, not an authorization protocol, this means that the Kerberos protocol, through the use of TGT, TGS tickets and other related data, is able both to prove to the remote service that the domain user trying to access is indeed a valid domain user, already authenticated and present in the AD (Network Logon) (<a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#1>link</a>), and to the Client when the user performs a standard login to the machine (Interactive Logon) (<a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#2>link</a>); instead, authorization, so the verification of the permissions in order to access to the target service is the responsibility of the AP, that is the server hosting the service (Network Logon) (<a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#3>link</a>), while to the Client it&rsquo;s the responsibility of the Client itself (Interactive Logon) (<a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#4>link</a>).</p><p>Kerberos implements the concept of &ldquo;Ticket&rdquo;, they are &ldquo;objects&rdquo; that will be used to perform domain authentications.
This protocol is called Kerberos, like the three-headed dog of Greek mythology, because in its complete operation (for example from Interactive Logon to Network Logon) it involves 3 distinct actors:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Client / User</strong>: The Client (it&rsquo;s also possible to say the user who has logged into the Client) wants to access a service that requires domain authentication.</p></li><li><p><strong>Application Server (AP)</strong>: The service that the client (or user) wants to access.</p></li><li><p><strong>Key Distribution Center (KDC)</strong>: The Kerberos protocol, to operate, requires the involvement of a Third Party called the Key Distribution Center, which is a functionality of the DC and will be the true core of the protocol and the responsible entity (through its features) for issuing the different Tickets.</p><p><span id=7>Specifically, the KDC supports a functionality called Authentication Server (AS), this feature is the one that will actually issue the Tickets called TGT, in some guides it is also said that the KDC has another functionality called Ticket-Granting Server which will be responsible for issuing the other type of Ticket, that is the TGS, that said, for simplicity in this section, instead of specifying the Ticket-Granting Server we will say that it is the KDC itself that issues the TGS.</p></li></ul><p>The Active Directory of a Domain Controller will act as the KDC and the listening ports that expose the service (and therefore the functionalities) of Kerberos will be 88 TCP and 88 UDP.</p><p><strong>Kerberos Flow:</strong></p><img src=/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/kerberos_flow.png class=center style=border-radius:8px><blockquote><p><span id=40>In the following sections we&rsquo;ll describe the traditional process where Kerberos is used, so from an Interactive Logon where a user enters their credentials within a WinLOGON GUI, to a subsequent Network Logon (using the credentials cached) to authenticate to a target service; in reality, the Kerberos authentication process can actually also begin using other <a href=https://www.alteredsecurity.com/post/fantastic-windows-logon-types-and-where-to-find-credentials-in-them>Logon Type</a> besides the traditional WinLOGON GUI (Interactive Logon), for example: performing a Kerberos authentication to a service (for instance the SMB service using the PsExec utility from Sysinternals) specifying domain credentials that are different from the ones currently in use; since the Client does NOT have the TGT Ticket of the requested credentials cached (because it logged into the Client with another account) a full Kerberos authentication will be performed.</p></blockquote><h2 id=kerberos-flow---interactive-login><strong>Kerberos Flow - Interactive Login</strong></h2><span id=39><ol><li><h3 id=krb_><strong>KRB_AS_REQ: Request of the TGT Token from the Authentication Server (AS)</strong></h3></li></ol><p>The Kerberos protocol is (typically) initialized when a user needs to perform an <a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/windows-authentication/windows-logon-scenarios#BKMK_InteractiveLogon>Interactive Logon</a> (<a href=https://zer1t0.gitlab.io/posts/attacking_ad/#interactive-logon>1</a>) within a Client using domain credentials, that is by filling in the traditional Windows credential form, also called WinLogon GUI.</p><img src=/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/interactive_logon.png class=center style=border-radius:8px><p>To authenticate, the user enters the credentials on the Client (DOMAIN\User & Password) and everywhing will be shared in cleartext with the &ldquo;LSASS&rdquo; process.</p><p><span id=6>After that, LSASS delegates the authentication to its SSPs, so some DLLs (APIs) that can be loaded within the &ldquo;lsass.exe&rdquo; process, consequently the LSASS process loads and shares in cleartext the credentials with all the SSPs dedicated to authentication (kerberos.dll - manage Kerberos, msv1_0.dll - manage NTLM Authentication, wdigest.dll - manage Digest); that said, since the LSASS process does NOT know which SSP to use, <a href=https://syfuhs.net/what-happens-when-you-type-your-password-into-windows>it will use them one by one in sequential order until a correct authentication takes place</a>, consequently, since Windows will recognize that it is a domain user entered, it will start with the &ldquo;kerberos.dll&rdquo; DLL, it then calculates the NT hash of the corresponding previously entered password (which it received in plaintext) and after that contacts the AS (Authentication Service which is a feature of the KDC, that is the DC) to request the issuance of a Ticket called &ldquo;TGT&rdquo; and a &ldquo;TGS Session Key&rdquo;, specifically the LSASS process sends a KRB_AS_REQ which contains:</p><img src=/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/krb_as_req.png class=center style=border-radius:8px><ul><li><p><strong>Authenticator</strong>: the timestamp contained within it will be encrypted with the user’s hash, while other values such as the ‘username’ field, which contains the name of the domain user we are logging in with, will all be in plain-text.</p></li><li><p><span id=5><strong>SPN - krbtgt</strong>: It will be indicated in the dedicated field, the SPN related to the Kerberos service (KDC) of the Domain Controller which is equal to krbtgt/[&lt;domain>].</p><p>A Service Principal Name (SPN), <a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#service-principal-name-spn>as we explain later</a> is a unique identifier for the instance of a service, SPNs are used by Kerberos authentication to associate the instance of a service (simplifying: the start & running of the service such as for example Microsoft SQL) with a so-called &ldquo;Logon Account&rdquo;, so a domain user (which in this way it will becomes a Service Account); in other terms, (generically speaking) an SPN can be considered as a generic object that represents the association between a service and a domain user, that said, technically, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc772815%28v=ws.10%29#service-principal-names">it is an attribute of the &ldquo;Users&rdquo; object</a> and in fact from it one can list the related SPNs; this essentially means that through an SPN it is possible to map the start & the running of a service present on a server with a domain user rather than associating it with a &ldquo;Standard Service Account&rdquo; such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/it-it/windows/win32/services/networkservice-account?redirectedfrom=MSDN">NetworkService Account</a>; finally, it should be noted that also Computer Accounts have SPNs.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note 1</strong>: If the DC is not accessible when a Client performs a domain authentication, the Client checks whether such credentials are present within the <a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/user-profiles-and-logon/cached-domain-logon-information>Domain Credential Cached (DCC)</a> which stores the last domain users logged into the machine (only if a user authenticates correctly and has the permissions to access the Client), if they are also NOT present there then the login is rejected.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Note 2</strong>: As we will see later, if a domain user has the <a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/active-directory/useraccountcontrol-manipulate-account-properties>DONT_REQ_PREAUTH</a> flag enabled, the AS will respond with a valid KRB_AS_REP (response) even if the KRB_AS_REQ (request) packet does not have the &ldquo;Timestamp&rdquo; encrypted with the NTHash of the user’s password.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span id=32><strong>Note 3</strong>: For simplicity of explanation everything has been described in this way, what will happen in reality is that the Client will first send a &ldquo;KRB_AS_REQ&rdquo; packet to the AS NOT encrypting the Timestamp with the NT Hash of the current user and only when the AS responds with an error &ldquo;KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED&rdquo; then the Client will send a new &ldquo;KRB_AS_REQ&rdquo; with the Timestamp encrypted, this is the <a href="https://youtu.be/4LDpb1R3Ghg?t=3167">reason</a> why by analyzing everything with Wireshark in a traditional Kerberos authentication one can notice such error message.</p></blockquote></li></ul><ol start=2><li><h3 id=krb_-1><strong>KRB_AS_REP: AS sends the TGT token to the Client</strong></h3></li></ol><span id=9>The AS (a feature of the KDC) after having received such request, using the username (which is not encrypted) as a keyword searches inside its Database for the password of that user in order to decrypt the message; if the AS correctly decrypts the message and the now decrypted timestamp falls within the time difference configured in the KDC, then the authentication has occurred successfully.<blockquote><p>If the domain user contained in the first KRB_AS_REQ interaction has the <a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/active-directory/useraccountcontrol-manipulate-account-properties>DONT_REQ_PREAUTH</a> property flag enabled, the AS will accept such authentication request as valid EVEN if the request does NOT have the &ldquo;timestamp&rdquo; value encrypted with the NT Hash of the domain user, in such case the AS will simply verify directly whether the timestamp falls within the time difference configured in the KDC; it is important to underline that if the domain user has such flag enabled, the AS will nevertheless respond with a valid KRB_AS_REP both if the KRB_AS_REQ packet has the &ldquo;timestamp&rdquo; encrypted (usually sent by the LSASS process in an Interactive Logon) and if it does NOT have the timestamp encrypted (usually sent by an attacker if performing an AS-REP Roasting Attack).</p></blockquote><p>If everything goes well, the AS responds to the client with a packet called KRB_AS_REP containing the TGT Ticket and the TGS Session Key (called &ldquo;Session Key&rdquo; within the screenshot), such TGS Session Key will be used subsequently as an encryption key for the possible following requests.</p><p>The KRB_AS_REP packet sent by the AS to the Client contains:</p><p><span id=12><img src=/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/krb_as_rep.png class=center style=border-radius:8px></p><ul><li><p><strong>Ticket TGT</strong>: The TGT Ticket which has been encrypted with the &ldquo;krbtgt hash&rdquo;, that is the hash (NT Hash) of the domain user called &ldquo;krbtgt&rdquo; (<a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#5>as previously specified</a>)
<span id=8>Since the Client for obvious reasons does not know the password hash of the KDC it cannot decrypt the TGT Ticket, this is not a problem because to obtain the TGS Ticket in the next step it is sufficient to send the TGT ticket as we received it, that is, encrypted.</p></li><li><p><strong>Other Data</strong>: Other various data, including the TGS Session Key, are encrypted with the hash (NT Hash) of the Client user who requested the domain authentication via Interactive Logon; in this way the KRB_AS_REP packet when sent by the AS to the Client even if intercepted via Man-In-The-Middle Attack, the attacker could not (hopefully 😉) decrypt the packet since they do not know the hash of the Client user.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>The AS will respond to the Client by sending a KRB_AS_REP with the TGS Session Key (plus other data) encrypted with the NTHash of the domain user regardless of whether it has the <a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/active-directory/useraccountcontrol-manipulate-account-properties>DONT_REQ_PREAUTH</a> flag enabled or not, such behavior will lead to an AS-REP Roasting type attack.</p></blockquote><hr><p><strong>So, what happens now?</strong></p><p>Below are the sequential steps that occur until the user’s home screen is loaded:</p><ul><li><span id=2><strong>Authentication</strong>: The Client has now obtained the KRB_AS_REP packet, consequently the LSASS process (or rather its SSP that established the connection, namely &ldquo;Kerberos.dll&rdquo;) performs the decryption of the portion of the KRB_AS_REP packet encrypted with the NT Hash of the domain account performing the authentication (this is because the Client intrinsically knows this value); if this activity is done correctly it means that the authentication has succeeded and for this reason the Kerberos AUTHENTICATION process ends.</li></ul><blockquote><p>It should be noted that the Client stores in memory the TGT Ticket received, this is the reason why if an attacker compromises this machine, they are able to perform a Pass-The-Ticket (PtT).</p></blockquote><ul><li><p><span id=4><strong>Authorization</strong>: The Client now needs to understand if the domain account authenticated via Kerberos has the authorizations to access, <a href=https://syfuhs.net/what-happens-when-you-type-your-password-into-windows>in order to do this</a>, it should retrieve the information of the authenticated account by inspecting the &ldquo;PAC&rdquo; contained in the received TGT Ticket, but, unfortunately, the PAC contained within the received TGT Ticket is inaccessible since the TGT Ticket is encrypted with the &ldquo;krbtgt&rdquo; hash, consequently, similarly to what happens in a Network Logon scenario (<a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#kerberos-flow---network-logon>as we will see later</a>), also in this Interactive Logon case, the Client will request a TGS Ticket BUT indicating in the dedicated field an <a href=https://en.hackndo.com/service-principal-name-spn/#edge-case---host>SPN of type &ldquo;HOST&rdquo;</a> related to the Client machine (ex: HOST\Workstation01") involved, since (1) the service account associated with the Client (ex: Workstation01) is its corresponding <a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#relationship-between-a-spn--computer-account>&ldquo;Computer Account&rdquo;</a> (ex: DOMAIN\Workstation01$), it will be possible to decrypt the TGS Ticket, extract the PAC and perform the authorization verification:</p><ol><li><strong>First Authorization Phase</strong>: The SSP &ldquo;kerberos.dll&rdquo; (so the Client) will send a KRB_TGS_REQ packet to the DC in order to request a TGS Ticket; instead of indicating an SPN of a target service (<a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#kerberos-flow---network-logon>as we will show later in the context of Network Logon</a>) it will indicate the &ldquo;HOST&rdquo; SPN related to the Client machine itself, so where the authentication has just taken place (ex: &ldquo;HOST\Workstation01&rdquo;); in this way the DC will respond with a KRB_TGS_REP containing a TGS Ticket encrypted with the Client’s domain account &ldquo;Computer Account&rdquo; (ex: DOMAIN\Workstation01$), since the LSASS process of the Client has in memory (specifically in the <a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/lsa-logon-session>LOGON SESSION</a>) the NT Hash of every Security Principal (every authenticated account) of the machine, including also its own <a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#relationship-between-a-spn--computer-account>&ldquo;Computer Account&rdquo;</a> (ex: DOMAIN\Workstation01$), it will use the NT Hash of such domain account to decrypt the TGS Ticket and then extract in plaintext the PAC contained within it (the PAC is simply &ldquo;signed&rdquo; by the DC with the &ldquo;krbtgt hash&rdquo;, not encrypted) with which it will perform the analysis related to authorizations.</li></ol><blockquote><p>The reason why this step is NOT usually described in a Kerberos authentication articles, is that the Kerberos authentication flow is often captured (from a Windows machine) by <a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#35>sniffing the network traffic with Wireshark after performing a &ldquo;klist purge&rdquo;</a> (by removing the TGT Ticket, the Client during a Kerberos authentication will necessarily have to re-perform a complete Kerberos authentication); with this procedure, this specific step will NOT be executed because the domain account since is already authenticated on the Client, the Client will NOT need to perform again the AUTHORIZATION check and for this reason it will NOT send this packet during the sniffing.</p></blockquote><ol start=2><li><strong>Second Authorization Phase</strong>: Another component of the LSASS process will compare the content of the PAC (SID, Group & etc. related to the domain account logged on to the Client) just extracted against the Client’s ACLs and, if positive, the AUTHORIZATION phase performed by the Client will end.</li></ol></li></ul><p><strong>If positive</strong>:</p><ol><li><p>The SSP &ldquo;Kerberos.dll&rdquo;

(SPN)</strong></h2><h3 id=what-2><strong>What&rsquo;s a Service Principal Name (SPN)?</strong></h3><p>A &ldquo;<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_account>Service Account</a>&rdquo; is nothing more than an account created and used for the start & running of a specific service, furthermore, if this service needs to interact with other services it can do it using its own &ldquo;Service Account&rdquo;.</p><p>In a classic scenario when the local or domain user &ldquo;BOB&rdquo; starts the software &ldquo;Notepad&rdquo; application, the operating system runs &ldquo;Notepad&rdquo; using the account &ldquo;BOB&rdquo;, when a Service Account is used, instead, the OS will start the service (for example MSSQL) using that specific Service Account, this will mean that viewing the running processes though Task Manager it will be possible to see that the service &ldquo;Microsoft SQL&rdquo; is running with the related &ldquo;Service Account&rdquo;.</p><p>One type of &ldquo;Service Account&rdquo; are the &ldquo;<a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/service-user-accounts>Standard Service Account</a>&rdquo;, so &ldquo;Service Accounts&rdquo; that do NOT have passwords and they are used by Windows OS to start specific services usually system-related, the most common example is the &ldquo;<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/it-it/windows/win32/services/networkservice-account?redirectedfrom=MSDN">NetworkService Account</a>&rdquo; which is usually used to start the IIS or MSSQL Server service.</p><p><span id=30>A <a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/service-principal-names>Service Principal Name (SPN)</a> is a unique identifier of a service instance, SPNs are used by Kerberos authentication to associate the service instance (the start & running of the service, for example Microsoft SQL) with a &ldquo;Logon Account&rdquo; (which it will become Service Account); in other words, (generically speaking) an SPN can be considered as a generic object that represents the association between a service and a domain account, that said, technically, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc772815%28v=ws.10%29#service-principal-names">it is an attribute of the &ldquo;Users&rdquo; object</a>.</p><p><span id=31>&ldquo;Standard Service Accounts&rdquo; by definition are NOT &ldquo;Logon Accounts&rdquo; since they are used exclusively by the operating system and do NOT have passwords.</p><p>This essentially means that through an SPN it is possible to map the start & running of a service on a server to a domain account rather than associating it with a &ldquo;Standard Service Account&rdquo; such as the NetworkService Account.</p><p>Each service (hosted on a server joined into a domain) that wants a domain user to authenticate to it using the Kerberos protocol (Kerberos SSO) must necessarily have an SPN configured <a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#16>so that the potential &ldquo;Client&rdquo; (so the actor involved in Kerberos Authentication) can uniquely identify the service within the network</a>; if no SPN is set for a service, then the Client has NO way to locate the service and consequently the Kerberos authentication is NOT possible.</p><p>An SPN (so an attribute of the &ldquo;user&rdquo; object) is (usually, it&rsquo;s not mandatory) built using the name of the &ldquo;service class&rdquo; followed by the hostname that starts the service; finally, optionally, it can also include the port and an arbitrary name to associate:</p><p><span id=target-text2><img src=/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/spn1.png class=center style=border-radius:8px></p><p>For example: A SPN named &ldquo;DNS/dc01.capsule.corp&rdquo; rappresent a DNS Service hosted on the DC01.capsule.corp associated with a domain user like &ldquo;capsule.corp\arbitrary_dnsuser&rdquo;.</p><p>Microsoft has documented a (non-exhaustive) list of the so-called &ldquo;service_class,&rdquo; that is, standard names used to indicate certain types of services; as you can see, the most common are <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc772815%28v=ws.10%29#service-principal-names">CIFS, DNS, SPOOLER and WWW</a>.</p><h3 id=relationship-between-a-spn--computer-account><strong>Relationship Between a SPN & Computer Account</strong></h3><p>In a domain scenario, each &ldquo;person&rdquo; within the organization will have its own domain user account (so a &ldquo;Users&rdquo; object); that said, every computer joined to the domain will also have its own associated domain account, called a &ldquo;Computer Account&rdquo; or &ldquo;Machine Account&rdquo; (<a href=https://itfreetraining.com/lesson/computer-accounts/>1</a>, <a href=https://zer1t0.gitlab.io/posts/attacking_ad/#computer-accounts>2</a>) which will be used by the Client itself (or more precisely by the SYSTEM account of the Client) for activities where it needs to interact with other entity joined within the domain, for example checking if it is necessary to update the &ldquo;Group Policies&rdquo; (Client -> Domain Controller), <a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#4>verifying the permissions of a domain account authenticated to the computer with Kerberos and so on</a>.</p><p>The difference between a &ldquo;User&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Computer Account&rdquo; is that even though both are domain user that exists and are registered on the DC, the first is an object of type &ldquo;<a href=https://www.windows-active-directory.com/active-directory-user-objects-management.html>User</a>,&rdquo; while the second, that is, the &ldquo;Computer Account,&rdquo; is instead <a href=https://zer1t0.gitlab.io/posts/attacking_ad/#computer-accounts>a subclass of the &ldquo;User&rdquo; class</a> (so we can say it&rsquo;s a user) BUT it is stored within a &ldquo;Computer&rdquo; object.</p><p>The following command queries the DC and requests to print on screen all the domain accounts that exists in the AD; as you can see, in addition to the Administrator account, there are: the nominal account (tstark, fcastle, pparker), the service account (SQLService) and 3 other accounts indicated with a $ at the end of the syntax, those are the &ldquo;Computer Accounts&rdquo;; all &ldquo;Computer Accounts&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Machine Accounts&rdquo;) have as their name the associated hostname and end with the $ sign.</p><img src=/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/spn2.png class=center style=border-radius:8px><p>Consequently, &ldquo;HYDRA-DC$&rdquo; is the &ldquo;Computer Account&rdquo; of the Domain Controller HYDRA-DC, &ldquo;THEPUNISHER$&rdquo; is the &ldquo;Computer Account&rdquo; of the Client THEPUNISHER, and finally &ldquo;SPIDERMAN$&rdquo; is the &ldquo;Computer Account&rdquo; of the Client SPIDERMAN.</p><p><span id=34>A &ldquo;Computer Account&rdquo; (Machine Account), unlike a traditional domain user, is automatically generated by the DC when the computer is joined to the domain; specifically, the computer itself randomly (<a href=https://zer1t0.gitlab.io/posts/attacking_ad/#kerberoast>120 characters</a>) creates the password (and then shares it with the DC) and by default it will use the machine’s hostname followed by a $ for the creation of the name; that said, the password of the domain account &ldquo;Computer Account&rdquo; is instead changed <a href="https://adsecurity.org/?p=280">by default</a> (this timing is configurable - <a href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/askds/machine-account-password-process/396026>1</a>, <a href=https://zer1t0.gitlab.io/posts/attacking_ad/#lsa-secrets>2</a>) every 30 days.</p><p>In addition to the existence of SPNs that allow associating a domain user (becoming a Service Account in this scenario) with a specific service, so by setting a specific &ldquo;Service Class&rdquo; such as CIFS or others, there is also a SPNs of type &ldquo;HOST&rdquo;.</p><p>Technically, <a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#30>as previously told</a>, an SPN was created with the purpose of associating a service with a Service Account (domain user), a SPN of type HOST is the exception to this rule since the keyword &ldquo;HOST&rdquo; is NOT a service but directly represents the whole &ldquo;computer&rdquo; object itself, in order to associate a whole &ldquo;Computer&rdquo; object with a Service Account via SPN, in reality a trick is used, essentially the keyword HOST in order to represent the whole machine but having to necessarily specify a service, the &ldquo;HOST&rdquo; Service Class is an ALIAS (<a href=https://en.hackndo.com/service-principal-name-spn/#edge-case---host>1</a>, <a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-spnmappings>2</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc772815%28v=ws.10%29#service-principal-names">3</a>) that groups together all the possible <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc772815%28v=ws.10%29#service-principal-names">Service Class</a> of an SPN such as CIFS, WWW, DNS etc, subsequently it was defined that the Service Account that can be associated with the &ldquo;Computer&rdquo; object (which indirectly holds the Host SPN) via SPN is its corresponding &ldquo;Computer Account&rdquo;, in other words, for example: The SPN &ldquo;HOST\Workstation1&rdquo; links the Computer object &ldquo;Workstation1&rdquo; to the Service Account &ldquo;Workstation1$&rdquo; (which is a Computer Account).</p><blockquote><p>When a machine is joined to the domain, the corresponding AD Object of type &ldquo;computers&rdquo; is created within the domain, when this happens the Domain Controller automatically creates 2 SPNs to attach to it that follow the following syntax: &ldquo;HOST/&lt;HOSTNAME>&rdquo; & &ldquo;HOST/&lt;HOSTNAME>.&lt;DOMAIN>&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><span id=17>Finally, it should be specified that if a service is run on a computer with a &ldquo;Standard Service Account&rdquo; (for example Local System / NetworkService Account), such as by default the CIFS / LDAP services, if these services need to use the Kerberos protocol (for example they accept a Kerberos domain authentication) the computer will use the &ldquo;Computer Account&rdquo; of the machine that host these services as their Service Account (in this scenario the &ldquo;secrets&rdquo; of the Computer Account will be used to encrypt the TGS Ticket); this happens because the &ldquo;Standard Service Account&rdquo; (ex Local System / NetworkService Account) <a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#31>exists only in a local context</a>.</p><blockquote><p>The Service Class &ldquo;HOST&rdquo; also has another utility, since it is assigned by default to a newly created &ldquo;Computer&rdquo; object & it&rsquo;s an alias of ALL &ldquo;Service Classes&rdquo;, it natively configure the domain environment to allow a Client to perform a Kerberos Authentication against commonly used services (e.g: CIFS for SMB authentication, HTTP for WinRM authentication) sparing the Sysadmin the tedious task of manually assigning these SPNs to each machine when it&rsquo;s needed.</p></blockquote><h2 id=inspect-the-kerberos-yourself><strong>Inspect the Kerberos yourself!</strong></h2><p>Now that the theory has been explained i recommend moving on to practice!</p><p><span id=35>For educational purposes i recommend creating your own personal lab, there are several resources online that detail <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xftEuVQ7kY0">how to do this</a>, once this has been done, it will be possible to use WireShark to analyze the traffic started from a Kerberos authentication, to see the whole process we can for example run the command &ldquo;klist purge&rdquo; (which removes all the Cached Kerberos Tickets) on a domain joined Windows machine and perform a Network Logon authentication to another machine within the network, for example via SMB, if you have do this you will see all the Kerberso traffic generated.</p><img src=/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/kerberos_wholeflow.png class=center style=border-radius:8px><p>As you can see with the following traffic has been generated:</p><ol><li>KRB_AS_REQ</li></ol><p>The reason why the 2 &ldquo;KRB_AS_REQ&rdquo; packets were sent <a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#32>has been previously

this example inside the SMB protocol.</li></ul><h3 id=how-to-decrypt-kerberos-traffic><strong>How to decrypt Kerberos traffic</strong></h3><p>As previously analyzed, some portions of the Kerberos packets will be encrypted with the krbtgt account secrets (TGT Ticket) or with the Service Account secrets related to the service hosted by the AP (TGS Ticket), to be able to analyze everything in plain-text it&rsquo;s necessary to properly configure Wireshark, specifically it is possible to provide Wireshark with a &ldquo;<a href=https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-devel/doc/basic/keytab_def.html>keytab</a>&rdquo; file containing ALL the secrets (NT Hash & <a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#kerberos-keys>Kerberos Key</a>) related to the entities involved in Kerberos authentication, in this way Wireshark will be able to decrypt the part.</p><blockquote><p><a href=/posts/not_so_brief_overview_about_kerberos/#34>As already explained</a>, since by default the DC changes the password of ALL Computer Accounts every 30 days, if this behavior is not disabled / modified, the operation will need to be repeated periodically.</p></blockquote><p>To do this, one can perform a DCSync on the Domain Controller and retrieve the NT Hashes, AES-256 Kerberos Key, and AES-128 Kerberos Key of each involved &ldquo;Principal&rdquo; (Domain Users & Computer Accounts & krbtgt user), then insert these values into the dedicated section in the &ldquo;<a href=https://github.com/dirkjanm/forest-trust-tools/blob/master/keytab.py>keytab.py</a>&rdquo; script and finally execute the script to generate the &ldquo;keytab.kt&rdquo;
