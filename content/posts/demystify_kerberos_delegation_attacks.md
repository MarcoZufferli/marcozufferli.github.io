### 1. KRB\_TGS\_REQ: The Client provides its own TGT Ticket to the KDC to request the TGS Ticket.
### 2. KRB\_TGS\_REP: The KDC sends the TGS Ticket to the Client BUT specifying that the requested service has the Kerberos Unconstrained Delegation enabled.
### 3. KRB\_TGS\_REQ: The Client requests a "Ticket TGT Forwarded" from the KDC.
### 4. KRB\_TGS\_REP: The KDC sends a "Ticket TGT Forwarded" to the Client.
### 5. KRB\_AP\_REQ: The Client attempts to access the Front-End AP by providing its own TGS Ticket BUT also sharing the so-called "Ticket TGT Forwarded".
### 6. KRB\_TGS\_REQ: The Front-End AP provides the Clientâ€™s "Ticket TGT Forwarded" to the KDC to request a TGS Ticket.
### 7. KRB\_TGS\_REP: The KDC sends the TGS Ticket to the Front-End AP.
### 8. KRB\_AP\_REQ: The Front-End AP presents the TGS Ticket to the Back-End AP to authenticate on behalf of the Client.)
